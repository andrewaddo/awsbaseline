This section will give you an introduction to AWS Identity Access Management and and a step-by-step guide to setting it up.

### What are the expected outcomes?

1. Understand IAM and IAM Best Practices
2. Successfully setup IAM Users, Group and Roles
3. Successfully configure policies and MFA

### Pre-requisites

1. None

## What is IAM and Why You Should Set it Up

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

You can watch the video below to have a quick over of IAM

### Here are the Benefits of AWS IAM

* **Shared access to your AWS account**: You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.

* **Granular permissions**: You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources. 

* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security. With MFA you or your users must provide not only a password or access key to work with your account, but also a code from a specially configured device.

You can find more details in this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).

This [documentation] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html#intro-video) will provide you the comprehensive list of features and benefits of IAM

 ## Best Practices for AWS IAM Setup

 These are the list of setup configurations that you must have to ensure a secure environment

* **Root Account Protection**

You use an access key (an access key ID and secret access key) to make programmatic requests to AWS. However, do not use your AWS account root user access key. The access key for your AWS account root user gives full access to all your resources for all AWS services, including your billing information. You cannot reduce the permissions associated with your AWS account root user access key.
Therefore, protect your root user access key like you would your credit card numbers or any other sensitive secret.

* **Least Privilege**

When you create IAM policies, follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege, or granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users (and roles) need to do and then craft policies that allow them to perform only those tasks.

Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.

* **User Permissions on Groups**

Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.). Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

* **Enable MFA**

For extra security, we recommend that you require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users in your account. With MFA, users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. Both the user's credentials and the device-generated response are required to complete the sign-in process. If a user's password or access keys are compromised, your account resources are still secure because of the additional authentication requirement.

## Setting up AWS IAM

Setting IAM is quick and easy as you will see in the [video] (https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-new-iam-user/) here.
